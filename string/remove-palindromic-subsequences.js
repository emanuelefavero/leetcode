// * Remove Palindromic Subsequences

/*
You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

function removePalindromeSub(s) {
  for (let i = 0, j = s.length - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
    if (s[i] !== s[j]) return 2
  }

  return 1
}

// -------------------------
// TESTS

console.log(removePalindromeSub('ababa')) // 1
// Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.
console.log(removePalindromeSub('abb')) // 2
// Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
