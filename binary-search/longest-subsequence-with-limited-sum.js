// * Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum

/*
You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[]} queries

// TIP: This is not a binary search solution but is the most simple and common

// O(n * m) time | O(1) space
function answerQueries(nums, queries) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)
