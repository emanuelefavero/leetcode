// * Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

/*
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

// TODO: add jsDoc

function findMin(nums) {
  let left = 0
  let right = nums.length - 1

  while (left < right) {
    let middle = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)

    if (nums[middle] < nums[right]) right = middle
    else left = middle + 1
  }

  return nums[left]
}

// -------------------------
// TESTS

console.log(findMin([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])) // 1
console.log(findMin([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2])) // 0
console.log(findMin([11, 13, 15, 17])) // 11
