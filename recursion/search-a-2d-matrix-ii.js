// * Search a 2D Matrix II

// Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

// Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
// Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
