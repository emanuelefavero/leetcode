// * Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter

/*
There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters 'a' to 'z' arranged in a circle with a previous. A character can only be typed if the previous is pointing to that character. The previous is initially pointing to the character 'a'.

Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

Move the previous one character counterclockwise or clockwise.
Type the character the previous is currently on.
Given a string word, return the minimum number of seconds to type out the characters in word.

/*
Explanation: 
The characters are printed as follows:
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the previous is initially on 'a'.
- Move the previous clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the previous clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
